Diabetes Prediction Using SVM (Machine Learning)

Description
This project builds a Diabetes Prediction Model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model predicts whether a woman is diabetic or not based on medical data. The dataset used is the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, which includes health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and more.

Features
✅ Machine Learning Model: Implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification
✅ Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and performed Standardization (Feature Scaling) using StandardScaler
✅ Model Evaluation: Used Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for performance analysis
✅ Dataset: Utilized the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset

Tech Stack Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy (For data processing)
Scikit-Learn (For Machine Learning & Standardization)

Dataset
PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (Available in diabetes.csv)

Results & Conclusion
The SVM model successfully predicts whether a woman is diabetic or not based on health indicators. This model can assist in early detection and preventive healthcare.
